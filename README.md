# Canvas Homepage
The idea for this app was born just to solve my personal pain point: as a mixed-media mutidimensional creative, the limits of social media have become too... _limiting_.

So were the traditional website constructors.

So I have decided to brush off those react skills (despite being Software Dev for quite a bit, I've basically never engaged with ui).

The idea of this is to make a highly customizable collage-like website builder. Think tumblr but with a canvas.

This is simultaneously my attempt at learning with an open garage door...


## ðŸŒ³ This is the very beginning...

First commit March 24th 2024 - Setting up the canvas with some basic figures.
Next steps:
- Add transformers for the boxes
- Create mock files, render objects dynamically
- Hook up the database
- Spin up an express server (while we're at it, maybe explore next....???)
